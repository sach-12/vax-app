A Flutter-Based Android app that automates the entire CoWIN booking portal. From giving vaccine preferences and fee type, to automatically detecting the user's location and giving them a choice of pincode,
this app completely rids the user of the hassle of booking from the CoWIN site. In addition, one can download appointment slips, certificates and even cancel appointments from here.
